<h2><p>Welcome to the official website of Kabitirthey Sarodotsab, one of the renowned Durga Pujos of the Kolkata Port area in Kidderpore,Kolkata.
</p>
<p>Founded in 1953, the name Kabitirtha is a tribute to the 3 great Bengali poet's who made Kidderpore their karmabhoomi; Hemchandra Bandyopadhyay,  Ranagalal Bandyopadhyay and Michael Mashusudan Dutta. 
</p>
<p>Our pujo is renowned for the worship of the Maheswari/ Rudrani roop of Ma, where she is clad in tigerskin and adorned with rudraksha malas.
    Our interpretation of Ma has remained unchanged over the years, and that is what endears us to people across the city and beyond. We prominently featured in the Dunlop Pujo guide of yesteryears, which was the yardstick of a heritage pujo at that time.</p>
